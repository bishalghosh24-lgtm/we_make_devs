# üíñ Aura: Your Supportive Peer Mentor

Aura is an empathetic AI chatbot designed to be a supportive peer and a safe space for reflection. Powered by the Cerebras Cloud API and personalized with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Aura tailors its conversations to your unique personality, providing a more meaningful and understanding interaction.

## ‚ú® About The Project

In a world of generic chatbots, Aura stands out by focusing on **personalization and empathy**. The core idea is to create an AI companion that doesn't just answer questions, but understands your communication style and underlying traits. By integrating the MBTI framework, Aura adapts its tone, logic, and advice to align with your personality type, whether you're a logical INTJ or a creative ENFP.

This project was built to explore the potential of large language models in creating nuanced, supportive, and persistent user experiences.
